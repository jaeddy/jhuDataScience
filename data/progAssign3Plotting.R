## Read the outcome data into R via the read.csv function and look at the Ô¨Årst 
## few rows.
outcome <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
head(outcome)

## There are many columns in this dataset. You can see how many by typing 
## ncol(outcome) (you can see the number of rows with the nrow function). In 
## addition, you can see the names of each column by typing names(outcome) 
## (the names are also in the PDF document.

## To make a simple histogram of the 30-day death rates from heart attack 
## (column 11 in the outcome dataset), run
outcome[, 11] <- as.numeric(outcome[, 11])

## You may get a warning about NAs being introduced; that is okay
hist(outcome[, 11])

## Because we originally read the data in as character (by specifying 
## colClasses = "character" we need to coerce the column to be numeric. You may 
## get a warning about NAs being introduced but that is okay.
