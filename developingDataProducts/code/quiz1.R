# Question 1: Consider the following code for the cars data set
library(manipulate)
myPlot <- function(s) {
    plot(cars$dist - mean(cars$dist), cars$speed - mean(cars$speed))
    abline(0, s)
}

# This function plots distance versus speed, each de-meaned and an associated
# line of slope s. Which of the following code will make a manipulate plot that
# creates a slider for the slope?

manipulate(myPlot, s = slider(0, 2, step = 0.1))
manipulate(myPlot(s), s = slider(0, 2, step = 0.1)) # <<<
manipulate(myPlot(s), slider = x(0, 2, step = 0.1))
manipulate(myPlot(s), x.s = slider(0, 2, step = 0.1))


# Question 2: Which of the following code uses the rCharts package to create a
# sortable and searchable data table for the airquality data set? Assume the
# rCharts package and the airquality data set have already been loaded into R.
data(airquality)
library(rCharts)

dTable(airquality, sPaginationType = "full_numbers") # <<<
d <- data.frame(airquality, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) print(d)
airquality
head(airquality)


# Question 3: A basic shiny data product requires:

# A ui.R and server.R file or a A server.R file and a directory called www
# containing the relevant html files. <<<
# A server.R file only.
# A ui.R file only.
# A shiny.R file.


# Question 4: What is incorrect about the followig syntax in ui.R?

library(shiny)
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
    headerPanel("Data science FTW!"),
    sidebarPanel(
        h2('Big text')
        h3('Sidebar')
    ),
    mainPanel(
        h3('Main Panel text')
    )
))

# The h3 command should be an h2 command.
# The h2 command has the wrong arguments.
# Missing a comma in the sidebar panel  <<<
# The "Sidebar" should say "Sidebar text".


# Question 5: Consider the following code in ui.R
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
    headerPanel("Example plot"),
    sidebarPanel(
        sliderInput('mu', 'Guess at the mu',value = 70, min = 60, max = 80, 
                    step = 0.05,)
    ),
    mainPanel(
        plotOutput('newHist')
    )
))


# And the following server.R code.

library(UsingR)
data(galton)

shinyServer(
    function(input, output) {
        output$myHist <- renderPlot({
            hist(galton$child, xlab='child height', col='lightblue',
                 main='Histogram')
            mu <- input$mu
            lines(c(mu, mu), c(0, 200),col="red",lwd=5)
            mse <- mean((galton$child - mu)^2)
            text(63, 150, paste("mu = ", mu))
            text(63, 140, paste("MSE = ", round(mse, 2)))
        })
        
    }
)

# Why isn't it doing what we want?

# The server.R output name isn't the same as the plotOutput command used in 
# ui.R.  <<<
# The limits of the slider are set incorrectly and giving an error.
# It should be mu <- input$mean in server.R
# The phrase "Guess at the mu value" should say "mean" instead of "mu"
